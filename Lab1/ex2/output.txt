IF YOU CAN READ THIS MESSAGE, YOU HAVE FOUND THE CORRECT KEY
FOR THE VIGENERE CIPHER. WE HOPE THAT YOU NEVER USE THIS CIPHER
FOR SAFETY-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS :).

IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY THE FREQUENCY ANALYSIS SIGNIFICANTLY, THE
FIRST FEW SENTENCES FROM DANIEL DEFOE'S ROBINSON CRUSOE FOLLOW:

I WAS BORN IN THE YEAR 1632, IN THE CITY OF YORK, OF A GOOD
FAMILY, THOUGH NOT OF THAT COUNTRY, MY FATHER BEING A FOREIGNER
OF BREMEN, WHO SETTLED FIRST AT HULL. HE GOT A GOOD ESTATE BY
MERCHANDISE, AND LEAVING OFF HIS TRADE LIVED AFTERWARD AT YORK,
FROM WHENCE HE HAD MARRIED MY MOTHER, WHOSE RELATIONS WERE
NAMED ROBINSON, A GOOD FAMILY IN THAT COUNTRY, AND FROM WHOM I
WAS CALLED ROBINSON KREUTZNEAR; BUT BY THE USUAL CORRUPTION OF
WORDS IN ENGLAND WE ARE NOW CALLED, NAY, WE CALL OURSELVES, AND
WRITE OUR NAME, CRUSOE, AND SO MY COMPANIONS ALWAYS CALLED ME.
